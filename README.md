 fluentd configuration guide for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) 
 
Hello Github community,

I would like to share with you a configuration of fluentd for Cisco Web Security Appliance syslog parsing. 
It includes adding geopoint information and other enhancements.

Use it, fork it, do whatever you like.
