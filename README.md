Hello Github community,

I would like to share with you a configuration of fluentd for Cisco Web Security Appliance syslog parsing. 
It includes adding geopoint information and other enhancements.

Plugins used:
geoip - https://github.com/y-ken/fluent-plugin-geoip
record_transformer

Use it, fork it, do whatever you like.
